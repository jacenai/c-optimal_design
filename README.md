# c-optimal design

In clinical doseâ€“response studies, researchers aim to balance efficacy and safety when selecting optimal doses for drug development. The Clinical Utility Index (CUI) provides a quantitative framework for this balance by combining multiple clinical attributes into a single, interpretable metric. It converts complex trade-offs between therapeutic benefit and potential risk into a unified measure of overall desirability, enabling transparent and evidence-based decision making. Building on this principle, Magnusdottir (2013) proposed c-optimal designs for the bivariate Emax CUI model, which minimize the asymptotic variance of the estimated optimal dose that maximizes the expected CUI. However, obtaining such designs numerically is computationally demanding due to the nonlinear and multi-parameter structure of the model. This Shiny app addresses this challenge by implementing Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), a gradient-free metaheuristic algorithm that efficiently searches for c-optimal designs. It provides a fast, flexible, and user-friendly platform for identifying the most informative dose combinations that jointly characterize efficacy and safety, marking the first interactive tool for optimal CUI-based dose selection. The app is available freely at [https://jiachenai.shinyapps.io/c-optimal_by_PSO/](https://jiachenai.shinyapps.io/c-optimal_by_PSO/) and can reproduce all the same results in the four Tables in Magnusdottir (2013), and more.
